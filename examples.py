BEFORE YOU R EAD
They say faith can move mountains. But what should we put our
faith in? This is the question this story delicately poses.
Lencho is a farmer who writes a letter to God when his crops
are ruined, asking for a hundred pesos. Does Lencho’s letter reach
God? Does God send him the money? Think what your answers to
these questions would be, and guess how the story continues, before
you begin to read it.
Activity
1.One of the cheapest ways to send money to someone is through
the post office. Have you ever sent or received money in this
way?  Here’s what you have to do.  (As you read the instructions,
discuss with your teacher in class the meanings of these words:
counter , counter clerk, appr opriate, acknowledgement, counter foil,

THE house — the only one in the entire valley — sat
on the crest  of a low hill. From this height one
could see the river and the field of ripe corn dotted
with the flowers that always promised a good
harvest. The only thing the earth needed was a
downpour or at least a shower . Thr oughout the
morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately
— had done nothing else but see the sky towards
the north-east.
“Now we’r e really going to get some water , woman.”

Lencho had predicted, big drops of rain began to
fall. In the north-east huge mountains of clouds
could be seen approaching. The air was fresh and
sweet. The man went out for no other reason than
to have the pleasure of feeling the rain on his body,
and when he returned he exclaimed, ‘‘These aren’t
raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
The big drops are ten cent pieces and the little ones
are fives.’’
With a satisfied expression he regarded the field
of ripe corn with its flowers, draped  in a curtain of
rain. But suddenly a strong wind began to blow
and along with the rain very large hailstones began
to fall. These truly did resemble new silver coins.
The boys, exposing themselves to the rain, ran out
to collect the frozen pearls.
‘‘It’s really getting bad now,’’ exclaimed the man.
“I hope it passes quickly.” It did not pass quickly.
For an hour the hail rained on the house, the
garden, the hillside, the cornfield, on the whole
valley. The field was white, as if covered with salt.
Not a leaf remained on the trees. The corn was
totally destroyed. The flowers were gone from the
plants. Lencho’s soul was filled with sadness. When
the storm had passed, he stood in the middle of the
field and said to his sons, “A plague of locusts  woulddraped

That night was a sorrowful one.
“All our work, for nothing.”
‘‘There’s no one who can help us.”
“We’ll all go hungry this year .”
Oral Comprehension Check
1.What did Lencho hope for?
2.Why did Lencho say the raindrops were like ‘new coins’?
3.How did the rain change? What happened to Lencho’s fields?
4.What were Lencho’s feelings when the hail stopped?
But in the hearts of all who lived in that solitary
house in the middle of the valley, there was a single
hope: help from God.
“Don’t be so upset, even though this seems like
a total loss. Remember , no one dies of hunger .”
“That’s what they say: no one dies of hunger .”
All through the night, Lencho thought only of
his one hope: the help of God, whose eyes, as he
had been instructed, see everything, even what is
deep in one’s conscience. Lencho was an ox of a
man, working like an animal in the fields, but still
he knew how to write. The following Sunday, at
daybreak, he began to write a letter which he
himself would carry to town and place in the mail.
It was nothing less than a letter to God.
“God,” he wrote, “if you don’t help me, my family
and I will go hungry this year . I need a hundr ed
pesos  in order to sow my field again and to live
until the crop comes, because the hailstorm.. ..”
He wrote ‘To God’ on the envelope, put the letter
inside and, still troubled, went to town. At the post
office, he placed a stamp on the letter and dropped
it into the mailbox.
One of the employees, who was a postman and
also helped at the post office, went to his boss
laughing heartily and showed him the letter to God.

that address. The postmaster — a fat, amiablepeso

immediately he turned serious and, tapping the
letter on his desk, commented, “What faith! I wish I
had the faith of the man who wr ote this letter .
Starting up a correspondence with God!”
So, in order not to shake the writer’s faith in God,
the postmaster came up with an idea: answer the
letter. But when he opened it, it was evident that to
answer it he needed something more than goodwill,
ink and paper . But he stuck to his r esolution: he
asked for money from his employees, he himself gave
part of his salary, and several friends of his were
obliged to give something ‘for an act of charity’.
It was impossible for him to gather together the
hundred pesos, so he was able to send the farmer
only a little more than half. He put the money in an
envelope addressed to Lencho and with it a letter
containing only a single word as a signature: God.
Oral Comprehension Check
1.Who or what did Lencho have faith in? What did he do?
2.Who read the letter?
3.What did the postmaster do then?
The following Sunday Lencho came a bit earlier
than usual to ask if there was a letter for him.
It was the postman himself who handed the letter
to him while the postmaster , experiencing the
contentment of a man who has  performed a good
deed, looked on from his office.
Lencho showed not the slightest surprise on
seeing the money; such was his confidence — but
he became angry when he counted the money. God
could not have made a mistake, nor could he have
denied Lencho what he had requested.
Immediately, Lencho went up to the window to
ask for paper and ink. On the public writing-table,
he started to write, with much wrinkling of his brow,
caused by the effort he had to make to express his
ideas. When he finished, he went to the window to

6.There are two kinds of conflict in the story: between humans and nature,
and between humans themselves. How are these conflicts illustrated?
I.Look at the following sentence from the story.
Suddenly a strong wind began to blow and along with the rain very large
hailstones began to fall.
‘Hailstones’ are small balls of ice that fall like rain. A storm in which
hailstones fall is a ‘hailstor m’. Y ou know that a stor m is bad weather with
strong winds, rain, thunder and lightning.

II.Notice how the word ‘hope’ is used in these sentences from the story:
(a)I hope it (the hailstorm) passes quickly.
(b)There was a single hope: help from God.
In the first example, ‘hope’ is a verb which means you wish for something to
happen. In the second example it is a noun meaning a chance for something
to happen.

9III.Relative Clauses
Look at these sentences
(a)All morning Lencho — who knew his fields intimately  — looked at
the sky.
(b)The woman, who was pr eparing supper , replied, “Y es, God willing.’’
The italicised parts of the sentences give us more information about Lencho
and the woman. W e call them relative clauses . Notice that they begin with
a relative pronoun  who. Other common relative pronouns are whom , whose ,
and which
.
The relative clauses in (a) and (b) above are called non-defining , because
we already know the identity of the person they describe. Lencho is a
particular person, and ther e is a particular woman he speaks to. W e don’t
need the information in the relative clause to pick these people out from a
larger set.
A non-defining relative clause usually has a comma in front of it and a
comma after it (some writers use a dash (—) instead, as in the story). If the
relative clause comes at the end, we just put a full stop.
Join the sentences given below using who, whom , whose , which , as
suggested.
1.I often go to Mumbai. Mumbai is the commercial capital of India. ( which)
2.My mother is going to host a TV show on cooking. She cooks very
well. ( who)B
–a feeling that something good will
probably happen
–thinking that this would happen
(It may or may not have happened.)
–stopped believing that this good
thing would happen
–wanting something to happen
(and thinking it quite possible)
–showing concern that what you
say should not offend or disturb
the other person: a way of being
polite
–wishing for something to happen,
although this is very unlikelyA
1.Will you get the subjects you want
to study in college?
I hope so.
2.I hope you don’t mind my saying
this, but I don’t like the way you
are arguing.
3.This discovery will give new hope
to HIV/AIDS sufferers.
4.We wer e hoping against hope  that
the judges would not notice our
mistakes.
5.I called early in the hope of
speaking to her before she went

6.Just when everybody had given up
hope, the fishermen came back,

has been excellent. ( whose )
4.Lencho prayed to God. His eyes see into our minds. ( whose )
5.This man cheated me. I trusted him. ( whom )
Sometimes the relative pronoun in a relative clause remains ‘hidden’. For
example, look at the first sentence of the story:
(a)The house — the only one in the entire valley — sat on the crest of a
low hill.
We can r ewrite this sentence as:
(b)The house — which was  the only one in the entire valley — sat on
the crest of a low hill.
In (a), the relative pronoun which and the verb was are not present.
IV.Using Negatives for Emphasis
We know that sentences with wor ds such as no, not or nothing  show the
absence of something, or contradict something. For example:
(a)This year we will have no corn. (Corn will be absent)
(b)The hail has left nothing. (Absence of a crop)
(c)These aren’t raindrops falling from the sky, they are new coins.
(Contradicts the common idea of what the drops of water falling from
the sky are)
But sometims negative words are used just to emphasise an idea. Look at
these sentences from the story:
(d)Lencho…had done nothing else but  see the sky towards the north-
east. (He had done only this)
(e)The man went out for no other reason than  to have the pleasure of
feeling the rain on his body. (He had only this reason)
(f)Lencho showed not the slightest surprise  on seeing the money.
(He showed no surprise at all)
Now look back at example (c). Notice that the contradiction in fact serves to
emphasise the value or usefulness of the rain to the far mer.
Find sentences in the story with negative words, which express the
following ideas emphatically.
1.The trees lost all their leaves.
2.The letter was addressed to God himself.
3.The postman saw this addr ess for the first time in his car eer.

The word metaphor  comes from a Greek word meaning ‘transfer’. Metaphors
compare two things or ideas: a quality or feature of one thing is transferred
to another thing. Some common metaphors are
•the leg of the table:  The leg supports our body. So the object that supports
a table is described as a leg.
•the heart of the city:  The heart is an important organ in the centre of our
body. So this word is used to describe the central area of a city.

chap_1_summary = '''Chapter Sketch
The story recounts the hard life and extreme faith in God of a poor farmer (Lencho) who has lost his crop due to heavy rain and hailstones. It was the only source of income to fulfil his family’s desires. He firmly believes that God will help him in such a situation and would not let him and his family die due to hunger. He writes a letter to God to seek help. Some kind employees of the post office helped him. So, the story tells us to have faith in God and never lose hope in adverse situations.

About the Characters
Lencho A poor farmer who lives on the crest of a low hill with his family. He was a firm believer of God. He is innocent, hopeful, caring and responsible.
Postmaster A fat, amiable fellow who helped Lencho to retain his faith in God. He gave a part of his salary in the charity for Lencho on behalf of God.

OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER

Lencho’s Hope of Good Harvest
Lencho was a farmer who lived on the crest of a low hill with his family. His was the only house in the entire valley. His field was full of ripe corn and easily visible from the house. He was eagerly waiting for a good rain to have a good harvest so he could earn money for his family.

Turning of Lencho’s Hope into Despair
As Lencho hoped, it started raining at the time of supper which gave Lencho a ray of hope. He was extremely happy to see that. He compared the raindrops as silver coins which shows his joy.
But soon his joy turned into despair as the rain changed into hailstones which ruined the crops. The field had been covered with snow like a layer of white salt. Lencho was worried for his family.

Lencho’s Firm Belief in God
Though Lencho was a poor farmer and had lost all his crops, he had firm faith in God. He found in God his last hope and decided to write a letter to God for help. He asked God to send him a hundred pesos so that he can sow his field again and support his family until the new crops were harvested.
He also wrote that if God didn’t help him, his family would die with hunger.

The Postmaster’s Reaction to Lencho’s Letter
After reading Lencho’s letter to God, the postmaster laughed but soon realised that Lencho had firm faith in God and his belief should not be shaken. So, he decided to help Lencho with the help of his post office employees. He collected seventy pesos and handed the envelope to Lencho himself in which he also contributed a part of his salary.

Lencho Gets Angry at Receiving Less Money
Lencho became angry when he saw seventy pesos in the envelope as he demanded a hundred pesos. He did not believe that God could do so and send L n less money. So, he decided to write a letter again for the rest of money. This time he requested God not to send the rest of the money through the letter because he thought that the post office employees were ‘bunch of crooks’ who might have stolen his money.

A few moments later we all lifted our eyes in
awe as a spectacular array of South African jets,
helicopters and troop carriers roared in perfect
formation over the Union Buildings. It was not only
a display of pinpoint precision and military force,
but a demonstration of the military’s loyalty to
democracy, to a new government that had been
freely and fairly elected. Only moments before, the
highest generals of the South African defence force
and police, their chests bedecked with ribbons and
medals from days gone by, saluted me and pledged
their loyalty. I was  not unmindful of the fact that
not so many years before they would not have
saluted but arrested me. Finally a chevron  of Impala
jets left a smoke trail of the black, red, green, blue
and gold of the new South African flag.
The day was symbolised for me by the playing of
our two national anthems, and the vision of whites
singing ‘Nkosi Sikelel –iAfrika’ and blacks singing
‘Die Stem’, the old anthem of the Republic. Although
that day neither group knew the lyrics of the anthem
they once despised, they would soon know the
words by heart.
On the day of the inauguration, I was
overwhelmed  with a sense of history. In the first
decade of the twentieth century, a few years after
the bitter Anglo-Boer war and before my own birth,
the white-skinned peoples of South Africa patched
up their differences and erected a system of racial
domination against the dark-skinned peoples of their
own land. The structure they created formed the
basis of one of the harshest, most inhumane,
societies the world has ever known. Now, in the
last decade of the twentieth century, and my own
eighth decade as a man, that system had beennot unmindful of

That day had come about through the
unimaginable sacrifices of thousands of my people,
people whose suffering and courage can never be
counted or repaid. I felt that day, as I have on so
many other days, that I was simply the sum of all
those African patriots who had gone before me. That
long and noble line ended and now began again
with me. I was pained that I was not able to thank
them and that they were not able to see what their
sacrifices had wrought.
The policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting
wound in my country and my people. All of us will
spend many years, if not generations, recovering
from that profound  hurt. But the decades of
oppression and brutality had another , unintended,
effect, and that was that it produced the Oliver
Tambos, the W alter Sisulus, the Chief Luthulis, the
Yusuf Dadoos, the Bram Fischers, the Robert
Sobukwes of our time* — men of such extraordinary

21 Nelson Mandela: Long W alk to Freedomcourage, wisdom and generosity that their like may
never be known again. Perhaps it requires such
depths of oppression to create such heights of
character . My country is rich in the minerals and
gems that lie beneath its soil, but I have always
known that its greatest wealth is its people, finer
and truer than the purest diamonds.
It is from these comrades in the struggle that I
learned the meaning of courage. T ime and again, I
have seen men and women risk and give their lives
for an idea. I have seen men stand up to attacks
and torture without breaking, showing a strength
and resilience  that defies the imagination. I learned
that courage was not the absence of fear , but the
triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does
not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear .
No one is born hating another person because of
the colour of his skin, or his background, or his
religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can
learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love
comes more naturally to the human heart than its
opposite. Even in the grimmest times in prison, when
my comrades and I were pushed to our limits , I would
see a glimmer of humanity in one of the guards,
perhaps just for a second, but it was enough to
reassure me and keep me going. Man’s goodness is
a flame that can be hidden but never extinguished.

22First Flightsociety, each man is able to fulfil those obligations
according to his own inclinations  and abilities. But
in a country like South Africa, it was almost
impossible for a man of my birth and colour to fulfil
both of those obligations. In South Africa, a man of
colour who attempted to live as a human being was
punished and isolated. In South Africa, a man who
tried to fulfil his duty to his people was inevitably
ripped from his family and his home and was forced
to live a life apart, a twilight existence of secrecy
and rebellion. I did not in the beginning choose to
place my people above my family, but in attempting
to serve my people, I found that I was prevented
from fulfilling my obligations as a son, a br other , a
father and a husband.
I was not born with a hunger to be free. I was born
free — free in every way that I could know. Free to
run in the fields near my mother’s hut, free to swim
in the clear stream that ran through my village, free
to roast mealies under the stars and ride the broad
backs of slow-moving bulls. As long as I obeyed my
father and abided by the customs of my tribe, I was
not troubled by the laws of man or God.
It was only when I began to learn that my boyhood
freedom was an illusion, when I discovered as a
young man that my freedom had already been taken
from me, that I began to hunger for it. At first, as a
student, I wanted freedom only for myself, the
transitory freedoms of being able to stay out at night,
read what I pleased and go where I chose. Later , as
a young man in Johannesburg, I yearned for the
basic and honourable freedoms of achieving my
potential, of earning my keep, of marrying and
having a family — the freedom not to be obstructed
in a lawful life.
But then I slowly saw that not only was I not
free, but my brothers and sisters were not free. I
saw that it was not just my freedom that was
curtailed, but the freedom of everyone who looked
like I did. That is when I joined the African National
Congress, and that is when the hunge r for my own

frightened young man into a bold one, that drove a
law-abiding attorney to become a criminal, that
turned a family-loving husband into a man without

than the next man, but I found that I could not
even enjoy the poor and limited freedoms I was
allowed when I knew my people were not free.
Freedom is indivisible; the chains on anyone of
my people were the chains on all of them, the
chains on all of my people were the chains on me.
I knew that the oppressor must be liberated just
as surely as the oppressed. A man who takes away
another man’s freedom is a prisoner of hatred; he is
locked behind the bars of prejudice  and narrow-

Sliding through long grass
Near the water hole
Where plump deer pass.

At the jungle’s edge,
Baring his white fangs, his claws,
Terrorising the village!

His strength behind bars,
Stalking the length of his cage,

This chapter has been taken from Nelson Mandela’s book of the same name ‘Nelson Mandela : A Long Walk to Freedom’. It provides us a glimpse of the early life of Nelson Mandela, his education, 30 years in prison and the pains he had suffered in his young age. The chapter recounts his fight for the freedom for his own people who were tortured by whites.
In the chapter Mandela gives two contradictory pictures of his own country-one, in which the blacks were tortured and suffered quietly and second, the blacks will be free to live the life of their own.

About the Characters
Nelson Mandela First black President of South Africa who fought for the equal rights of the black. He suffered a lot of pain for the freedom.
Zenani Daughter of Nelson Mandela who accompanied Mandela in his inauguration day. She was very much close to him.
Thabo Mbeki First Deputy President of South Africa who was very close to Mandela.
Mr. Deklerk Second Deputy President of South Africa

OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER

The Inauguration
It was 10th May the day of oath with a bright and shiny sun. Nelson Mandela was supposed to take oath as the first black President of South Africa. A large number of leaders all from around the world had gathered there to be the witness of the swearing-in ceremony of Nelson Mandela as the first black President. The inauguration ceremony took place in a big open building in Pretoria where the first democratic non-racial government was to be installed.

The Swearing-In Ceremony of Nelson Mandela
Nelson Mandela was accompanied by his daughter Zenani. Mr Deklerk was the first person who took oath as secpnd Deputy President followed by Mr Thabo Mbeki who sweared as the first Deputy President of South Africa. Nelson Mandela was the last person who sweared as the first black President of South Africa. He pledged to obey and uphold the Constitution and to devote himself to the well-being of the people. He also promised to make the nation free from poverty, deprivation, suffering and all sort of discrimination.

Display of the Military Power by South African Jets
When Mandela had taken oath, South African jets displayed the military power. It also showed the loyalty of military to democracy. The highest military generals saluted him. He recounted that they would have arrested him many years before.
It was followed by the playing of two national anthems. The whites’sang ‘Nkosi Sikelel’ the old song and the blacks sang ‘Die Stem’ the new song which marked the end of the ceremony.

Apartheid and South Africa
l Nelson Mandela reminiscences about days gone by which will soon be the part of history where the whites had formed a system of racial dominance against the blacks. It was the basis of the harsh societies which is now overturned. He says , that the policy of apartheid created a deep and lasting wound
on his country and its people.
Now it is the system that recognised the rights and freedom of all people.

Regret of Mandela and Remembrance of Freedom Fighters
On the auspicious day Mandela regretted the loss of thousands of people and remembered their sacrifices for the freedom from discrimination. He thought of himself as the sum of all those African patriots who sacrificed their lives before him. He was pained that he couldn’t thank them.
He recalled great freedom fighters like Oliver, Tambos, Walter Sisulu, Chief Luthuli, Yusuf Dadoo, etc. who were the men of uncommon courage, wisdom and generosity.
He said that the country is rich in minerals but its greatest wealth is its people.

Goodness and Duties of a Man
The author says that being white or black is not the token of your goodness or superiority. No one is born hating other, people should love one another which comes without force as it is natural. It is man’s essential goodness.
A man has to perform duties to his family, community and country which he didn’t see in his country before he pushed himself to fight for the blacks. A black man was punished if he tried to live like a human being and forced to live apart from his own people. So, he was not allowed to perform his duties to his family.

Meaning of Freedom by Mandela
As a kid Mandela had different meaning for being free as he wanted to run in the fields and wanted to stay out at night. As he grew older he wanted the freedom of livelihood for himself and his family.
But soon he realised that such freedom was only an illusion, j He realised that his brothers and sisters who looked like him were not free, so he joined African National Congress (ANC). His hunger for freedom became great for the freedom of his people. He desired that everyone should be given the right to live his life with dignity and respect. He wanted the oppressor and the oppressed to be liberated. As no one is free if one is taking someone else’s freedom. Only such feelings can bring true freedom for everyone.

Chapter Highlights

10th of May was, a day of freedom for South Africa and there was huge gathering of international leaders and dignitaries.
Inauguration ceremony or swearing in ceremony was being held in Union Building in Pretoria and first non-racial government took the charge.
Nelson Mandela gave speech on the victory for justice, peace and human dignity.
Mandela pledged to liberate his people from poverty, suffering and discrimination.
A colourful show by jets and helicopters to show military’s loyalty took place.
Singing of two national anthems was done-the old ‘Nkosi Sikelel’ by the whites and the new ‘Die stem’ by the blacks.
A new system that recognised the rights and freedom of all people was formed.
Mandela remembered and thanked the people who sacrificed their lives for the freedom.
Salutation to some great freedom fighters – Oliver Tambo, Walter Sisulu, Chief Luthuli, Yusuf Dadoo and others.
Mandela said in speech that a country is rich because of its people not because of the minerals. Courage is not the absence of fear but the victory over it. People should love others and not hate them due to colour or religion. Love comes naturally not by force, which is the natural goodness.
He also stated that a man should try to make a balance between his duties – duty to his family and duty to his community and country. A black person was treated badly and not allowed to perform his duties.
According to Mandela, freedom has many aspects like – for a kid it is to run and play, for an adult it is to fulfil the needs, of his own and his family. Real freedom means equal rights for everyone.
Nelson Mandela joined the African National Congress (ANC). He desired people to live with dignity and respect. He wanted the oppressor and the oppressed to be liberated.
Patience and perseverance guided by discipline and system yield the desire result.'''

Since the earliest times, humans have dreamt of conquering the

His First Flight
THE young seagull was alone on his ledge. His two
brothers and his sister had already flown away the
day before. He had been afraid to fly with them.
Somehow when he had taken a little run forward to
the brink of the ledge and attempted to flap his
wings he became afraid. The great expanse of sea
stretched down beneath, and it was such a long
way down — miles down. He felt certain that his
wings would never support him; so he bent his head
and ran away back to the little hole under the ledge
where he slept at night. Even when each of his
brothers and his little sister , whose wings were far
shorter than his own, ran to the brink, flapped their
wings, and flew away, he failed to muster up courage
to take that plunge which appeared to him so
desperate. His father and mother had come aroundledge

calling to him shrilly, upbraiding  him, threatening
to let him starve on his ledge unless he flew away.
But for the life of him he could not move.
That was twenty-four hours ago. Since then
nobody had come near him. The day before, all day
long, he had watched his parents flying about with
his br others and sister , per fecting them in the art
of flight, teaching them how to skim  the waves and
how to dive for fish. He had, in fact, seen his older
brother catch his first herring  and devour it,
standing on a rock, while his parents circled around
raising a proud cackle. And all the morning the
whole family had walked about on the big plateau
midway down the opposite cliff taunting him with
his cowardice.
The sun was now ascending the sky, blazing on
his ledge that faced the south. He felt the heat
because he had not eaten since the previous nightfall.
He stepped slowly out to the brink of the ledge,
and standing on one leg with the other leg hidden
under his wing, he closed one eye, then the other ,herring

and pretended to be falling asleep. Still they took
no notice of him. He saw his two brothers and his
sister lying on the plateau dozing with their heads
sunk into their necks. His father was preening  the
feathers on his white back. Only his mother was
looking at him. She was standing on a little high
hump on the plateau, her white breast thrust
forward. Now and again, she tore at a piece of fish
that lay at her feet and then scrapped each side of
her beak on the rock. The sight of the food maddened
him. How he loved to tear food that way, scrapping
his beak now and again to whet  it.

get nearer to her as she flew across. But when
she was just opposite to him, she halted, her
wings motionless, the piece of fish in her beak
almost within reach of his beak. He waited a
moment in surprise, wondering why she did not
come nearer , and then, maddened by hunger , he
dived at the fish. With a loud scream he fell
outwards and downwards into space. Then a
monstrous terror seized him and his heart stood
still. He could hear nothing. But it only lasted a
minute. The next moment he felt his wings spread
outwards. The wind rushed against his breast

wings. He could feel the tips of his wings cutting
through the air . He was not falling headlong now.
He was soaring gradually downwards and outwards.
He was no longer afraid. He just felt a bit dizzy.
Then he flapped his wings once and he soared
upwards. “Ga, ga, ga, Ga, ga, ga, Gaw-col-ah,” his
mother swooped past him, her wings making a
loud noise. He answered her with another scream.
Then his father flew over him screaming. He saw
his two brothers and his sister flying around him
curveting  and banking  and soaring and diving.
Then he completely forgot that he had not always
been able to fly, and commended himself to dive
and soar and curve, shrieking shrilly.
He was near the sea now, flying straight over
it, facing straight out over the ocean. He saw a
vast green sea beneath him, with little ridges
moving over it and he turned his beak sideways
and cawed amusedly.
His parents and his brothers and sister had
landed on this green flooring ahead of him. They
were beckoning to him, calling shrilly. He dropped
his legs to stand on the green sea. His legs sank
into it. He screamed with fright and attempted to

1.Why was the young seagull afraid to fly? Do you think all young birds are
afraid to make their first flight, or are some birds more timid than others?
Do you think a human baby also finds it a challenge to take its first steps?
2.“The sight of the food maddened him.” What does this suggest? What
compelled the young seagull to finally fly?
3.“They were beckoning to him, calling shrilly.” Why did the seagull’s father
and mother threaten him and cajole him to fly?
4.Have you ever had a similar experience, where your parents encouraged
you to do something that you were too scared to try? Discuss this in pairs
or groups.
5.In the case of a bird flying, it seems a natural act, and a foregone conclusion

37 Two Stories about Fl yingII
The Black Aeroplane
THE moon was coming up in the east, behind me,
and stars were shining in the clear sky above me.
There wasn’t a cloud in the sky. I was happy to be
alone high up above the sleeping countryside. I was
flying my old Dakota aeroplane over France back to
England. I was dreaming of my holiday and looking
forward to being with my family. I looked at my
watch: one thirty in the morning.
‘I should call Paris Control soon,’ I thought. As I
looked down past the nose of the aeroplane, I saw
the lights of a big city in front of me. I switched on
the radio and said, “Paris Control, Dakota DS 088
here. Can you hear me? I’m on my way to England.
Over.”
The voice from the radio answered me immediately:
“DS 088, I can hear you. Y ou ought to tur n twelve
degrees west now, DS 088. Over .”
I checked the map and the compass, switched
over to my second and last fuel tank, and turned
the Dakota twelve degrees west towards England.
‘I’ll be in time for breakfast,’ I thought. A good
big English breakfast! Everything was going well —
it was an easy flight.
Paris was about 150 kilometres behind me when
I saw the clouds. Storm clouds. They were huge.
They looked like black mountains standing in front
of me across the sky. I knew I could not fly up and
over them, and I did not have enough fuel to fly
around them to the north or south.
“I ought to go back to Paris,” I thought, but I
wanted to get home. I wanted that breakfast.
‘I’ll take the risk,’ I thought, and flew that old
Dakota straight into the storm.
Inside the clouds, everything was suddenly black.
It was impossible to see anything outside the
aeroplane. The old aeroplane jumped and twisted
in the air . I looked at the compass. I couldn’t believe

my eyes: the compass was turning round and round
and round. It was dead. It would not work! The
other instruments were suddenly dead, too. I tried
the radio.
“Paris Control? Paris Control? Can you hear me?”
There was no answer . The radio was dead too. I
had no radio, no compass, and I could not see where
I was. I was lost in the storm. Then, in the black
clouds quite near me, I saw another aeroplane. It
had no lights on its wings, but I could see it flying
next to me through the storm. I could see the pilot’s
face — turned towards me. I was very glad to see
another person. He lifted one hand and waved.
“Follow me,” he was saying. “Follow me.”
‘He knows that I am lost,’ I thought. ‘He’s trying
to help me.’
He turned his aeroplane slowly to the north, in
front of my Dakota, so that it would be easier for
me to follow him. I was very happy to go behind the
strange aeroplane like an obedient child.
After half an hour the strange black aeroplane
was still there in front of me in the clouds. Now

there was only enough fuel in the old Dakota’s last
tank to fly for five or ten minutes more. I was
starting to feel frightened again. But then he started
to go down and I followed through the storm.
Suddenly I came out of the clouds and saw two
long straight lines of lights in front of me. It was a
runway! An airport! I was safe! I turned to look for
my friend in the black aeroplane, but the sky was
empty. There was nothing there. The black
aeroplane was gone. I could not see it anywhere.
I landed and was not sorry to walk away from the
old Dakota near the contr ol tower . I went and asked
a woman in the control centre where I was and who
the other pilot was. I wanted to say ‘Thank you’.
She looked at me very strangely, and then
laughed.
“Another aeroplane? Up there in this storm? No
other aer oplanes wer e flying tonight. Y ours was the
only one I could see on the radar .”
So who helped me to arrive there safely without
a compass or a radio, and without any more fuel in
my tanks? Who was the pilot on the strange black
aeroplane, flying in the storm, without lights?

WHAT WE HAVE DONE
Provided two stories about flying — one about a bird, another about a human being in
a plane.
WHAT YOU CAN DO
•As they read the story of the seagull, students can be asked to imagine how a baby
learns to walk, and compare and contrast the two situations.
Rationalised 2023-24
•After they read the second story students should be asked for their ideas about the
phantom plane: W as it really there or did the pilot imagine it? If the students feel it
was really there, who could have been piloting it?
•Ask students to narrate their own stories about flying. It could be about flying in an
airplane, or flying a kite, or about watching a bird flying — in short, anything to do
with flight. Give students ten minutes to think quietly about the topic — during this
time, they can make notes about what they want to say . Then ask for volunteer
speakers.

This humorous poem suggests some dangerous ways to identify (or
‘tell’) wild animals! Read it aloud, keeping to a strong and regular
rhythm.
If ever you should go by chance
To jungles in the east;
And if there should to you advance
A large and tawny beast,
If he roars at you as you’re dyin’
You’ll know it is the Asian Lion...
Or if some time when roaming round,
A noble wild beast greets you,
With black stripes on a yellow ground,
Just notice if he eats you.
This simple rule may help you learn
The Bengal T iger to discer n.
If strolling forth, a beast you view,
Whose hide with spots is peppered,
As soon as he has lept on you,
You’ll know it is the Leopard.
’Twill do no good to roar with pain,
He’ll only lep and lep again.

You meet a cr eatur e ther e,

He’ll give you just one more caress.
Though to distinguish beasts of prey
A novice might nonplus,
The Crocodile you always may
Tell from the Hyena thus:
Hyenas come with merry smiles;
But if they weep they’re Crocodiles.
The true Chameleon is small,
A lizard sort of thing;
He hasn’t any ears at all,
And not a single wing.
If there is nothing on the tree,
’Tis the chameleon you see.

3.Do you think the words ‘lept‘ and ‘lep’ in the third stanza are spelt correctly?
Why does the poet spell them like this?
4.Do you know what a ‘bearhug’ is? It’s a friendly and strong hug — such as
bears are thought to give, as they attack you! Again, hyenas are thought to
laugh, and crocodiles to weep (‘crocodile tears’) as they swallow their victims.

A boy loses a ball. He is very upset. A ball doesn’t cost much, nor is
it difficult to buy another ball. Why then is the boy so upset? Read
the poem to see what the poet thinks has been lost, and what the
boy has to learn from the experience of losing something.
What is the boy now, who has lost his ball,
What, what is he to do? I saw it go
Merrily bouncing, down the street, and then
Merrily over — there it is in the water!
No use to say ‘O there are other balls��:
An ultimate shaking grief fixes the boy
As he stands rigid, trembling, staring down
All his young days into the harbour where
His ball went. I would not intrude on him;
A dime, another ball, is worthless. Now
He senses first responsibility
In a world of possessions. People will take
Balls, balls will be lost always, little boy.
And no one buys a ball back. Money is external.
He is learning, well behind his desperate eyes,
The epistemology of loss, how to stand up
Knowing what every man must one day know
And most know many days, how to stand up.
JOHN BERRYMAN
O there are other balls : The words suggest that the loss is not important enough
to worry about
shaking grief:  sadness which greatly affects the boy

In pairs, attempt the following questions.
1.Why does the poet say, “I would not intrude on him”? Why doesn’t he offer
him money to buy another ball?
2.“… staring down/All his young days into the harbour where/His ball went …”
Do you think the boy has had the ball for a long time? Is it linked to the
memories of days when he played with it?

4.Do you think the boy has lost anything earlier? Pick out the words that
suggest the answer .
5.What does the poet say the boy is learning from the loss of the ball? Try to

STORY I His First Flight

Liam O’ Flaherty
This story is about a family of seagulls. There was a young child in the family who was unable to fly even after several tries. The story highlights the importance of family and friends in one’s life. It also gives the message that one needs to believe in self to overcome all the hurdles of own life.

The Seagull Family
The seagull family consists of six seagulls-mother, father, three sons and one daughter. All of them except the youngest son are expert in flying high. His parents have tried several times to teach him how to fly but he is scared to do that and does not want to try anymore. He relies on the food that his parents bring back from their flights.

Young Seagull’s Fear of Flyihg
The youngest son is afraid of flying as he thinks that if he flies, his wings would not support him and he would fall down in the sea below and drown. Even his parents have rebuked him. They even threatened him if he doesn’t fly, he would die of hunger but he does not try.

Parents Leave Young Seagull Alone
After so many failed attempts his parents leave him alone on the rock without food. They even taunt him for his cowardice. The young seagull looks at his brothers and sister enjoying swimming, diving in the sea water for fish to feed themselves, but no one comes near him to offer food.

Hunger and Heat Increase
As the time passes, the young seagull could not tolerate the hunger and the heat. He moves closer to the edge and pretends to fall asleep but nobody takes notice of him.His brothers and sister have already had hearty breakfast and father seems busy preening the feathers on his back. The mother looks at him and tries to tempt him with pieces of fish. Her begging and crying does not effect him.

Young Seagull Dives for Food
The young seagull was very hungry. He was surprised enough at his mothers’ ignorance of his pitiful condition. Thus, he dives for food. He begins to fall down with a scream as soon as he dives.

Flight Begins
The young seagull begins to fall in the sea. He is afraid of drawing, so he tries to spread his wings outwards and begins flying. He feels a little dizzy but all his fear vanished. He soars slowly, downwards and upwards. He could finally fly on his own.

Joy of Flight and Reunion of Family
The seagull becomes so happy and soars higher calling ‘ga, ga, gab It was really a joyous moment for the whole family; his brothers and sister alongwith his parents come near to encourage and cheer him. The young seagull successfully made his first flight.
